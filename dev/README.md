## TODO

- [ ] ActionBar hide...NO
- [ ] Close Menu...NO

> when hovering text input it shouldn’t show the 'click' cursor, but the normal text input selector when you open up the menu on the top right, clicking in the chat should close it. there should be a way to hide the top bar, I don’t need a constant reminder of what channel i’m in

- [x] Change default action

> should have an option to send with the enter key, rather than ctrl-enter

- [x] fix

> the tripcodes need a bit of space between them and the nicknames

- [ ] fix...NO

> hovering over a nickname sohuld have a 'click' cursor

- [ ] Invite
